# ✈️ British Airways Review Dashboard (Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **interactive Tableau Dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize **British Airways (BA) customer reviews** across multiple dimensions such as **country, rating, seat comfort, and overall experience**. The goal is to identify patterns in customer satisfaction and provide insights into factors that impact the airline’s performance.

The dashboard enables users to **filter by country, cabin type, and rating**, allowing for dynamic analysis and decision-making. This project is part of my **Tableau portfolio** to showcase advanced data visualization and storytelling skills.

The dataset and concept for this project were inspired by **[Mo Chen's Tableau Portfolio Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKAarfLRQ)**.  
This dashboard was built by me from scratch following the tutorial and adding my own enhancements for visualization and interactivity.
